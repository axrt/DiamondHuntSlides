## Ever searched for a </br> **diamond ring**?

---

## Actually... Forget the *ring* !
*(the setting I mean...)*

---

## Ever searched for a </br> **diamond**? ðŸ˜ƒ

---

If you have, you know how painful this process may be.  
The main question is:  
**"How does one choose a diamond  
and  
end up buying a good one?"**

---

The usual [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond) trick does not help much.

---

Fortunately, there is a bunch of  
**really good information pages**  
out there:  
<div class="extra">
    <a href="https://www.diamonds.pro">
        <img class="help_source" src="https://24zmsw8ynd-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/diamondspro/img/logo-light.png"></img>
    </a>
</div>
<div class="extra">
    <a href="http://www.4cs.gia.edu/EN-US/index.htm">
        <img class="help_source" src="http://www.benmadiamonds.com/Content/Media/GIA-LOGO.png"></img>
    </a>
</div>
<div class="extra">

    </a>
</div>

---

However, these sources have limited information on the  
**PRICE**  
for a given diamond with known 4C.  

---

Dozens of online stores allow to slice their databases to compare sets of diamonds and prices.  

---

Nevertheless, such a search should be implemented in a much more clean and simple way!

---

The data from [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) might help through the  
[Diamond Hunter](https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/application/75469)  
web app.

---

Suppose we have chosen a diamond:

<div class="extra">
<table class="comparison">
    <tr>
        <td>SHAPE</td>
        <td>CARAT WEIGHT</td>
        <td>COLOR</td>
        <td>CLARITY</td>
        <td>CUT</td>
        <td>PRICE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ROUND</td>
        <td>1.00</td>
        <td>D</td>
        <td>VVS2</td>
        <td>VERY GOOD</td>
        <td>$10,820</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p class="micro">data taken from jamesallen.com on 12.26.2015</p>
</div>

Looks like an exceptional diamond!  
But how does it compare to others?

---

Let's go to [Diamond Hunter](https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/application/75469) web app and see...

---

Here we select the parameters in the leftmost panel..

<div class="extra">
<img src="screen1.png"></img>
</div>

Point to a diamond and see its specifications!  
Apparently the closest one costs $10,800

---
We have 7 diamonds and ours is the most expensive.  
Have we chosen the one that is a bit overpriced ðŸ˜•?  
But wait...

---

Recall that an excellent round diamond must have a  
**table between 58% and 60%**  
and a  
**depth between 60% and 62%**  
<div class="extra">
<a href="http://smartcarat.com/diamond-smarts/diamond-depth-percentage/">
<img src="http://smartcarat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Depth1.jpeg"></img>
</a>
</div>
which brings us to the research of these parameters!

---

The **chosen diamond**  
has a **table of 59% and a depth 60.5%**.  
This one is truly excellent! Let's refine the search at the bottom of the parameters panel:

<div class="extra">
<img src="screen2.png"></img>
</div>

Aa-and we could not find a reference diamond to match ðŸ˜…, which means the others' fine parameters we slightly worse...

---

`...`and the **price bump for our diamond seems fair enough**.

---

If you forget, there is a help drop-down on the app page. Just point to the help field!

<div class="extra">
<img src="screen3.png"></img>
</div>

---

And don't hesitate to investigate. The diamond pricing *(as a function of diamonds' parameters)* is a cool thing!

## Tanks for watching!

---

## Appendix

---

I yet have to demonstrate the ability to do R coding in slidify.  
To do so I will briefly compare D and E colored diamonds. 

---

So, they say that it is very VERY hard (if not impossible) to tell a D from an F with a naked eye. But does a price differ significantly?

---
```{r prep, warning=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
data("diamonds")
library("plyr")
library("dplyr")
```
```{r main}
d.color<- diamonds %>% 
        select(carat, cut, color, clarity, price) %>% 
        #-3 cuz the last ones are not relevant
        filter(cut=="Ideal", color=="D", clarity=="VVS1") 
        #the IFs are rather rare
nrow(d.color) #number of Ds
f.color<- diamonds %>% select(carat, cut, color, clarity, price) %>%
        filter(cut=="Ideal", color=="F", clarity=="VVS1")
```
Here we have selected a group of D and F diamonds holding other important parameters equal.

---

```{r weight}
nrow(f.color) #number of Es
wilcox.test(d.color$carat, f.color$carat)
```
As we  see here , the mean weight is the same for the chosen groups (D and F). Let's see for the price.

---

```{r price}
wilcox.test(d.color$price, f.color$price)
```
The difference in the price is quite significant.

---

Conclusion: it might be a good idea to buy an F instead of a D, especially if nobody can tell the difference without equipment.

---

Thanks!
